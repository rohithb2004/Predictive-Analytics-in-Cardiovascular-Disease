Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Early diagnosis and intervention can significantly improve patient outcomes. Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used in predictive analytics to identify patterns, assess risks, and provide early warnings for CVDs.

Role of Machine Learning in Predictive Analytics
Machine learning techniques can analyze large datasets from electronic health records (EHRs), wearable devices, and medical imaging to predict cardiovascular conditions. These models help in risk stratification, early detection, and decision support for medical professionals.

Key Machine Learning Models Used
Logistic Regression – Used for binary classification (e.g., predicting the likelihood of a heart attack).

Decision Trees & Random Forest – Identify key risk factors using tree-based structures.

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) – Effective in handling high-dimensional medical data.

Neural Networks – Deep learning models analyze complex relationships in heart disease data.

Gradient Boosting Algorithms (XGBoost, LightGBM) – Improve prediction accuracy using ensemble methods.

Applications in Cardiovascular Disease
Risk Prediction – ML models predict the probability of heart diseases based on patient history.

Early Diagnosis – Detects warning signs of CVDs from ECGs, echocardiograms, and biomarkers.

Personalized Treatment Plans – Helps tailor treatment strategies based on individual risk profiles.

Remote Monitoring – Wearable devices use ML to track heart health and detect anomalies.# Predictive-Analytics-in-Cardiovascular-Disease
